# Multiple-language-study

For use you need Tampermonkey extension for your browser installed.

Just import the *Multi_language_prompt_on_pages.user.js* into it, 
and script should start working.


If you don't want it to work an (almost)all urls, you can change *@match* string manually:
```
// @version      0.1
// @description  Open a small window with a word or a phrase in multiple languages!
// @author       ukra174
// @match        your_url_match_string_here
// ==/UserScript==
```
